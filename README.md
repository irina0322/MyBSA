# MyBSA
My own little first program)

BSA is the surface area of the human body.
It is necessary to understand the results of medical ultrasound studies - how much the size of the organ corresponds to the height and weight of a person.

You just need to enter your height in centimeters and weight in kilograms and find out your BSA.
